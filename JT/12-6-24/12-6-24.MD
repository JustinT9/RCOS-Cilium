This week I continued my understanding and investigation related to the cilium benchmark 
network performance testing and this time, as recommended I looked into the yaml files 
that were used github workflows/action to understand what they did do and why we need them. 
I specifically looked into the yaml files that that contained conformance in them as recommended 
in https://github.com/cilium/cilium/tree/main/.github/workflows. 

I cherry picked some of the conformance yaml files that looked interesting and did a bit 
of work on understanding them e.g. https://github.com/cilium/cilium/blob/main/.github/workflows/conformance-aks.yaml
since most of them were quite lengthy as well as having the same patterns, which I recognized. 
It's interesting how the yaml files are used for github workflows which are paralleled to how 
jenkins uses groovy for its CI/CD workflows. 

In regards to conformance-aks.yaml, here is what I found interesting: 
```
name: Conformance AKS (ci-aks)

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      PR-number:
        description: "Pull request number."
        required: true
      context-ref:
        description: "Context in which the workflow runs. ..."
        required: true
      SHA:
        description: "SHA under test (head of the PR branch)."
        required: true
      extra-args:
        description: "[JSON object] Arbitrary arguments..."
        required: false
        default: '{}'
  push:
    branches:
      - 'renovate/main-**'
  schedule:
    - cron:  '0 0/8 * * *'
```
This workflow is named Conformance AKS which seems to take inputs under the workflow_dispatch 
field i.e. pull request numbers, context reference and SHA of a specific github branch. 
Also it seems like under the push field it implies that commits are pushed to branches 
called renovate/main-** and this kind of workflow runs every 8 hours it seems under schedule field. 

Now when it comes to the authentication component of the yaml file
```
permissions:
  actions: read
  contents: read
  pull-requests: read
  statuses: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: |
    ${{ github.workflow }}
    ${{ github.event_name }}
    ${{ (github.event_name == 'push' && github.sha) || ... }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```
There are the basic permissions you have that find typically in authentication e.g. 
read and write specifically with actions, contents, prs, statuses and id-token in this context 
when contributing to cilium. Additionally, under the concurrency field, it seems like 
there are different kinds of workflow instances, but it's difficult to decipher what it means. 

```
env:
  name: ${{ github.repository_owner }}-${{ github.event.repository.name }}-${{ github.run_id }}-${{ github.run_attempt }}
  cost_reduction: --node-vm-size Standard_B2s --node-osdisk-size 30
```
These are environment variables that seems to take the credentials of a github user contributing to cilium and 
specific limits to resources that a certain user can use with the virtual machine with cost_reduction. 

```
jobs:
  echo-inputs:
    if: ${{ github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' }}
    name: Echo Workflow Dispatch Inputs
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - name: Echo Workflow Dispatch Inputs
        run: |
          echo '${{ tojson(inputs) }}'
```
Now when it comes to the jobs component of the yaml file, there are different kinds of jobs 
that can be performed with regards to the workfload. This one seems to print and inputs provided 
in json file for debugging. 

```
generate-matrix:
  name: Generate Matrix
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  outputs:
    matrix: ${{ steps.set-matrix.outputs.matrix }}
    empty: ${{ steps.set-matrix.outputs.empty }}
  steps:
    - name: Checkout context ref (trusted)
      uses: actions/checkout@v4.2.2
      with:
        ref: ${{ inputs.context-ref || github.sha }}
    - name: Convert YAML to JSON
      run: |
        yq -o=json ".github/actions/azure/k8s-versions.yaml" > "/tmp/generated/azure.json"
    - name: Generate Matrix
      run: |
        cd /tmp/generated/azure
        jq '{ "include": [ .include[] | select(.default) ] }' azure.json > /tmp/matrix.json
```
This job generates a matrix on ubuntu with steps list for different k8 versions as it 
looks into the k8s-versions.yaml file. It also seems to checkout to a branch and 
convert that yaml file to jason.

```
installation-and-connectivity:
  name: Installation and Connectivity Test
  needs: generate-matrix
  if: ${{ needs.generate-matrix.outputs.empty == 'false' }}
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  timeout-minutes: 90
  strategy:
    fail-fast: false
    matrix: ${{fromJson(needs.generate-matrix.outputs.matrix)}}
  steps:
    - name: Create AKS cluster
      run: |
        az aks create \
          --resource-group ${{ env.name }} \
          --name ${{ env.name }} \
          --location ${{ matrix.location }} \
          --kubernetes-version ${{ matrix.version }}
    - name: Install Cilium
      run: |
        cilium install --helm-set cluster.name=${{ env.name }}
    - name: Run connectivity test
      run: |
        cilium connectivity test --junit-file results.xml
```
This job seems to deal with connectivity related matters and so I believe it installs cilium 
on an aks cluster by using the matrix job as before with a specified k8 version and 
installs cilium using helm and runs the connectivity test.

        shell: bash {0} # Disable default fail-fast behaviour so that all commands run independently
```
This part of the yaml file performs specific tests e.g. feature tests, unit testing connectivity testing 
which is important to ensure no test cases are broken.

```
  - name: Clean up Cilium
        run: |
          cilium uninstall --wait

 -   - name: Clean up AKS
        if: ${{ always() }}
        run: |
          az group delete --name ${{ env.name }} --yes --no-wait
        shell: bash {0} # Disable default fail-fast behaviour so that all commands run independently
```
Afterwards, it cleans up the resources that were installed by the jobs previously.
In general, these workflows are great when it comes to making sure whenever a contributor 
make changes to cilium, these jobs ensure that there is nothing missing before committing a 
contribution to the main cilium branch.

```
It looks like after the jobs and testing is done successfully, that means whatever contributions are made 
have its testing results and artifacts be uploaded to whatever Cilium would store their 
up to date production code and finalize the commits like how Jenkins performs their merging of new 
contributions to repositorys like Nexus when production deadlines are approaching.
